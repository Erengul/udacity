# Capstone Project

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the capstone project is to combine what I learned from the Data Engineering Nanodegree Program.

The Airbnb dataset was gathered, analyzed, and modeled. It was aimed to easily use by business units, data scientists. Also, database can be used to create queries for the Airbnb dataset. Users can find answers for questions such as "How many listings are available ?",  "What is the relationship between reviews and listings?", "What are the features of the listings that get the good/bad reviews?".


## Data Sources

Data was gathered from [kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/samyukthamurali/airbnb-ratings-dataset) This dataset contains the list of houses to be rented in New York, Los Angeles and the comments made by the users about these houses. For the project, two following files were used :


**NY_Listings.csv**
Includes 75.749 rows about the rentable houses. Columns information :

**airbnb-reviews.csv** Includes  14.864.421 rows about the reviews of customers. Columns information :

| airbnb-reviews |
|----------------|
| listing_id     |
| id             |
| date           |
| reviewer_id    |
| reviewer_name  |
| comments       |


Explore and Assess the Data :
- Null variables were determined. Null variables was written as 'NA' in raw files. To upload this fields on Redshift, defined as "NULL AS 'NA'" in copy sql statement.
- Csv files include header.
- String may contains invalid or unsupported UTF8 codepoints. To fix this, acceptinvchars statement is added to copy sql statement that move data from S3 to Redshift.
- Determined max length of strings. Some columns type like amenities are defined as varchar(max).


## Used Technologies


<ol>
<li> S3: Provides a platform for storage of data in the form of objects. In the project, log files were stored in the S3. It was located to the Amazon Service. </li>
<li> AWS Redshift: It is fast, simple, cost-effective data warehousing service In the project, it was used loading data from S3 into relational database. It was located to the Amazon clusters. </li>
<li> Airflow :It is a workflow automation and scheduling system that can be used to author and manage data pipelines. In the project, it was used to schedule and maintain etl jobs. </li>
<li> Redshift Query Editor : After loading tables in Redshift, it was used to check data quality.</li>
</ol>

## Prerequisites

- Before running dag, tables must be created on Redshift with using this file:

  create_tables.sql

- Csv files must be uploaded to S3 bucket :
<ol>
<li>Listing data: s3://airbnb-review/listing
<li>Review data: s3://airbnb-review/reviews
</ol>


## Data Model

In the project, database includes staging, fact and dimension tables. Staging tables are used to stored log data from the S3. All data is written in the staging tables without any change. Then for the final data model, fact and dimension tables are loaded from these staging tables. Business teams / data scientists etc. should be used final data model which includes fact and dimension tables.

### Staging Tables

<ol>
<li>staging_listings: records from s3://airbnb-review/listing to table

![schema](image/StagingListing.png)
*<font size="0.3"> All columns of the table are not shown in the picture.</font>

</li>
<li>staging_reviews : records from s3://airbnb-review/reviews to  table

![schema](image/StagingReviews.png)

</ol>

Then, according to analysis on staging tables, following issues are determined :

- The name of hosts can be different even if they have same host_id.
- The name of reviewers can be different even if they have same reviewer_id.

To solve this problem, the most recent record has been saved in dimension tables and below data quality checks are added to end of the dag :

- Checked primary keys values in case they can be null.
- Checked duplicated primary keys in dimension tables.

### Fact and Dimension Tables

**Final Database design below**:

![schema](image/ModelDiagram.png)

- For database design, star schema is chosen to simplify joins and meet business-technical needs with flexibility.
- Listing fact table is created from staging_listings. Reviews fact table is created from staging_reviews table. They are centered of the database design. Because they contain keys of dimension tables.
- With this design, users can find relation between listing and reviews.

## Scripts

- create_tables.sql : SQL for creating tables on redshift datawarehouse.
- sql_queries.py : Insert scripts for tables.
- data_quality.py : Checking row counts of table to ensure data quality.
- load_dimenison.py : Loading dimension tables from fact tables.
- load_fact.py :  Loading fact tables from staging tables
- stage_redshift.py : Loading data from CSV files on S3 to Redshift staging tables.

## ETL Pipeline

After defining the database design, ETL jobs were written to loading tables on Redshift.

ETL Design below :

![schema](image/ETLDiagram.png)

ETL jobs are scheduled with Airflow on hourly basis.
Airflow graph view :

![schema](image/AirflowGraphView.png)

Airflow tree view :

![schema](image/AirflowTreeView.png)

Airflow execution time :

![schema](image/AirflowGrant.png)

After loading the tables, tables can be checked from the Redshift.


## Scenarios

- If the data was increased by 100x :

  - Apache Spark can be used to processing data. Because Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing.
  -  Redshift is a distributed database so adding nodes will increased the writing and reading speed. Also distributed keys can be added to the tables.

- If the pipelines were run on a daily basis by 7am :
  - Data is kept up-to-date.
  - In addition, it allows early intervention in case of a possible error in the morning.
  - Warning features can be added to dag in case of a possible error.
  - If data is increased, dag's running time can be changed and loading speed can be decreased. It causes systems crush. In this situation, I recommend to run pipelines on at least hourly basis.

- If the database needed to be accessed by 100+ people :

  With Amazon Redshift, it can be accessed by this number of people without living any performance issues. If resources still are not enough, nodes can be added to Redshift cluster.
